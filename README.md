#Description of My Project
## A Homework Agenda
I will be creating a **homework agenda** for this project.

**Features of the homework agenda:**
- Students can include 
  the description of their homework and the subject of the homework in this homework agenda
- Once the students have completed the homework, the student will be able to remove the homework from the agenda.
- The student can enter a subject and then the agenda will be able to display what homework there is in the agenda 
  from that subject
- The student can delete all the homework with a specific subject
- The student can view all homework
- The student can see thte total number of homework
  
Students from elementary school and high school can use this agenda to keep track of their homework.

## Why does it interest me?
This project interest me because I have 
been using a homework agenda ever since I was grade 1 to be organized and to avoid forgetting due dates or homework. I 
used to use a paper agenda when I was young but once I got a phone, I downloaded an agenda app to keep track of my 
homework. I have tried many apps like that, but some of them are not convenient for users, so that is why I want to 
design a homework agenda that will be easy and convenient to use.
