#Description of My Project
## A Homework Agenda
I will be creating a **homework agenda** for this project.

**Features of the homework agenda:**
- Students can include 
  the description of their homework as well as the due date and the subject of the homework in this homework agenda
- Once the students have completed the homework, the student will be able to remove the homework from the agenda.
- The student can enter a date and then the agenda will be able to display what homework is due on 
  that day 
- The student can also enter a subject and then the agenda will be able to display what homework there is in the agenda 
  from that subject
  Students in elementary school, high school and university can use this agenda. 
  
Students from elementary school and high school can use this agenda to keep track of their homework.

## Why does it interest me?
This project interest me because I have 
been using a homework agenda ever since I was grade 1 to be organized and to avoid forgetting due dates or homework. I 
used to use a paper agenda when I was young but once I got a phone, I downloaded an agenda app to keep track of my 
homework. I have tried many apps like that, but some of them are not convenient for users, so that is why I want to 
design a homework agenda that will be easy and convenient to use.
